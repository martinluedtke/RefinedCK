# Refined Chabauty–Kim loci in depth 2

Tabulating the sizes of the refined Chabauty–Kim loci $X(\mathbb{Z}\_p)\_{\\{2,q\\},2}^{(1,0)}$ for various odd primes $q$ and auxiliary primes $p \not\in \\{2,q\\}$

 - `depth2_table.csv` is a CSV file containing the sizes of the loci for all $q < 100$ and $p < 1000$
 - `depth2-loci-3.txt` contains the data for $q = 3$ and $p < 5024$
 - `depth2-loci-5.txt` contains the data for $q = 5$ and $p < 5234$
 - `depth2-loci-7.txt` contains the data for $q = 7$ and $p < 5114$
 - `depth2-loci-11.txt` contains the data for $q = 11$ and $p < 7248$
