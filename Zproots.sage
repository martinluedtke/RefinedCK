Finding roots of p-adic power series

The function ``Zproots`` finds the set of roots in `\ZZ_p` of a p-adic power
series. Unlike the method ``polrootspadic`` from PARI/GP, this code works for
power series with inexact coefficients. This means that it detects when
the precision is insufficient to determine the set of roots. Moreover, roots
are computed with the precision to which they are known given the precision
of the power series.

def Zproots(f, coeff_prec=Infinity):
    r"""
    Compute the set of roots in `\ZZ_p` of a power series in `\QQ_p[[t]]`.

    Only a p-adic approximation of the power series is given. It is given by
    a polynomial ``f`` with p-adic coefficients along with an integer ``coeff_prec``
    indicating that ``f`` agrees with the true power series to this precision.

    INPUT:

    - ``f`` -- nonzero polynomial with coefficients in p-adic field

    - ``coeff_prec`` -- integer (default: ``Infinity``). Indicates that the
      polynomial ``f`` approximates the power series to this p-adic precision

    OUTPUT:

    The roots of `f` in `\ZZ_p` as a list of p-adic integers

    EXAMPLES:

    This example illustrates finding the square roots of 7 in `\ZZ_3`::

        sage: R.<t> = Qp(3)['t']
        sage: Zproots(t^2-7, 5)
        [2 + 3 + 3^2 + 2*3^3 + O(3^5), 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 2*3^4 + O(3^5)]

    There are no square roots of `-1` in `\ZZ_3`::

        sage: R.<t> = Qp(3)['t']
        sage: Zproots(t^2+1, 5)
        []

    The roots of `t^2 - 1` in `\ZZ_2` cannot be determined if the polynomial is
    only known to precision 2::

        sage: R.<t> = Qp(2)['t']
        sage: Zproots(t^2-1, 2)
        Traceback (most recent call last)
        ...
        PrecisionError: Insufficient precision to decide if root is liftable: 1 + O(2^2)

    The roots of `t^2 - 1` in `\ZZ_2` are determined to precision 2 if the
    polynomial is given with precision 3::

        sage: sage: R.<t> = Qp(2)['t']
        sage: Zproots(t^2-1, 3)
        [1 + O(2^2), 1 + 2 + O(2^2)]

    ALGORITHM:

    Normalise the polynomial so that it has coefficients in `\ZZ_p` and nonzero
    reduction modulo `p`. For each root modulo `p`, if it is simple, it lifts
    to a root in `\ZZ_p` by Hensel's lemma. Otherwise, traverse the lifts modulo
    higher powers of `p`, fixing higher p-adic digits in a depth-first manner,
    until we can decide whether the root lifts to `\ZZ_p` or until we detect
    that the precision of the polynomial insufficient to decide this.
